# Why Devops

### ⚡ _What is DevOps?_
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver 
applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional
software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and
compete more effectively in the market for access and billing. </br></br><img src="/Resources/Why_Needed/Devops_basic.png"/></br></br>
