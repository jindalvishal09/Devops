# Why Devops

### ⚡ _What is DevOps?_
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver 
applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional
software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and
compete more effectively in the market for access and billing. </br></br><img src="/Resources/Why_Needed/Devops_basic.png"/></br></br>

### ⚡ _Software Development in legacy system aka non-agile_
Every management process follows a set of principles. Here are the **three basic principles** the waterfall project management methodology goes by. 
1. **Sequential structure** :- The waterfall model **divides your operations into sequential phases.** You can only move to the next stage in your project once the current one is complete. This also means there’s **no space for changing course or revisiting a phase** after its completion. The only way to go back is to start all over again..
2. **Minimal customer involvement** :- A waterfall project involves **minimal customer interaction**. This is primarily due to the fact that operations only start after the customer’s requirements and objectives are clearly defined. The first meeting takes place before operations begin and the next when the project is in its final stages.
3. **Robust documentation** :- This methodology also involves **in-detail documentation** of all requirements, the development process, and the final outcome. This includes everything from the timeline to the precise route you will take to solve the client’s problems. Since there’s minimal to no customer communication during the development process, **every essential detail needs to be documented upfront.**
