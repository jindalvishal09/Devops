# Why Devops

### ⚡ _What is DevOps?_
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver 
applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional
software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and
compete more effectively in the market for access and billing. </br></br><img src="/Resources/Why_Needed/Devops_basic.png"/></br></br>

### ⚡ _Software Development in legacy system aka non-agile_
Every management process follows a set of principles. Here are the **three basic principles** the waterfall project management methodology goes by. 
1. **Sequential structure** :- The waterfall model **divides your operations into sequential phases.** You can only move to the next stage in your project once the current one is complete. This also means there’s **no space for changing course or revisiting a phase** after its completion. The only way to go back is to start all over again..
2. **Minimal customer involvement** :- A waterfall project involves **minimal customer interaction**. This is primarily due to the fact that operations only start after the customer’s requirements and objectives are clearly defined. The first meeting takes place before operations begin and the next when the project is in its final stages.
3. **Robust documentation** :- This methodology also involves **in-detail documentation** of all requirements, the development process, and the final outcome. This includes everything from the timeline to the precise route you will take to solve the client’s problems. Since there’s minimal to no customer communication during the development process, **every essential detail needs to be documented upfront.**


### ⚡ _5 Stages of the Waterfall Model – Software Development Cycle_

1. **Documenting Requirements** :- The waterfall model calls for extensive documentation upfront. In the first stage, you gather information from clients or end-users regarding their requirements and the results they expect from the software or product.This is a planning phase and is the last one where you can communicate with clients before work starts on the project
2. **Design** :- The second stage, also known as the analysis stage, is when you review the requirements and develop a design to meet them. Here, your team identifies the path it will take to deliver a solution and the relevant specifications. The second stage is often divided into two parts: the logical design and the physical design stage

3. **Implementation** :- This is where the action starts. The implementation phase is where the construction or coding, in the case of software development projects, happens. But this might be the shortest stage of all since the entire design is already in place. Your team will follow the documentation from the first two phases to flesh out the actual deliverable.More complex projects break down large software into smaller programs. Teams employ unit testing where they build and test one unit at a time which is later merged together for the final product. 
4. **Maintenance** :- The maintenance stage starts after you release the product and users start using it. You can only identify some issues once the client brings the deliverable to practical use. In case a bug or faulty feature arises, your maintenance team can take care of it. This stage ends when the client is fully satisfied or continues in case they need frequent updates

In a nutshell there are three teams or players into the play namely Development, Testing and IT operations. Developmet and testing being on the same side and IT operations as different. Both works with inherent conflict.

Develoment and testing works with an aim of keep developing new featus as much possible based on requirement while IT operations wants to provide stable, reliable, and secure service to the customer which means less frequesnt deployement. This brings us to **Andrew Clay Shafer** iconic picture of a wall between developers and operations with a metaphorical depiction of work being thrown over the wall. He coined this “the wall of confusion.”
